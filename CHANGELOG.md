# Version 1.0.8

No more Ironclad Models

# Version 1.0.7

Bleed now renders like Posion in the health bar, letting you see how much damage will occur.

Glutton Mod will no longer clash if loaded with Witch Mod.

# Version 1.0.6

Awesome new relic art for Muscle Shirt and Lucky Sock.

Tantrum will now work as intended, identifying the weakest living monster at the time it executes, not at the time of exhaustion. If you kill the weakest monster using Devour to exhaust Tantrum, Tantrum will now hit another monster rather than fizzling.

Fixed bug where Golden Armor would crash the Card Library

Minor Aesthetic Fixes

# Version 1.0.5

Changed more capitalization, fixed keywords.

# Version 1.0.4

Minor aesthetic changes. Updated pom for new basemod/stslib

# Version 1.0.3

Never mind about the Helix thing. It caused an annoying visual effect issue with other characters when helix is acquired.

# Version 1.0.2

The Glutton will no longer get Fossilized Helix as an option (since it is so terrible with its starting relic.)

# Version 1.0.1

Fixed visual effect error with Lucky Sock showing incorrect gold gain. (It was functionally correct).

# Version 1.0.0

Major release. All planned cards and relics are now included.

New character select button, courtesy of RedDyeNo5

Added 13 New Cards: Autotomy, Clot, Eat Alive, Feast, Fever, Hoard, Loot, Masochist, Rapacity, Regurgitate, Revivification, Shed Fat, and Vitality

Added new Uncommon Relic: Lucky Sock

Added new Rare Relic: Treadmill

Added new Rare Relic: Muscle Shirt

Mod is now safe for use with other mods. (At least, not id conflicts will occur).

Yearn has been tweaked to be less abusable as a common. Rather than cost zero, it costs 1, and discounts the echo it creates by 1. When used fairly, the total cost is unchanged.

Gold themed cards have been tweaked as a whole. Obsessive Greed now costs more when updated. Treasure now costs 1 and no longer grants gold, only heals, (and indicates how much it heals for). Gold gaining cards now visually work with Ectoplasm and Lucky Sock.

Chomp Art no longer overflows the borders.

Starvation Mode has been tweaked, to be The Glutton's "Form" power. It now costs three, but has a more impactful effect.

Enfeeblement no longer has a Fever Visions power secretly built into it.



# Version 0.5.0

Added 5 new cards: Enfeeblement, Malignancy, Reminisce, Starvation Mode, and Treasure

Added new Uncommon Relic: Half-Eaten Sandwich

Buffed Treat Slightly

Added STSLib as a dependency

# Version 0.4.0

Added 5 new cards: Distilled Agony, Hemophilia, Tantrum, Thrombosis, Torment

Added new Rare Relic: Syringe

Buffed Yearn (now costs 0).

Tweaked Debuff matters cards. Rather than caring about Weak/Vulnerable/Frail, they now trigger off of any debuff.

Yearn and Bloody Knuckles are now both the proper rarity (Yearn should have been common, Bloody Knuckes should have been uncommon).

Fixed Lash Out (Will now actually show up in runs, and will work properly at that.)

# Version 0.3.2

Nerfed Toxic Residue

Buffed Self Flagellate

Actually fixed Avarice for real

# Version 0.3.1

Nerfed Treat's Max HP gain

# Version 0.3

Added 5 new cards: Chomp, Chrysosphagy, Profligacy, Self Flagellate, and Yearn

Added 1 new relic: Amulet of Pain

Buffed Migraine

Fixed a bug with Avarice not being set to zero cost by attack potion or metamorphosis.

Fixed a bug where Glutton Relics appeared in the normal relic pool.

Minor Aesthetic changes.

# Version 0.2.1

Quality of Life hotfix for Delusion. Previous behavior: Card selection screen for Delusion warns about selecting etheral cards and, if they are selected, prevents an Echo from being made. New behavior: Players no longer have the option of selecting Etheral cards with Delusion.

# Version 0.2

Added 5 new cards: Belly Slam, Bloody Kuckle, Brace, Delusion, and Tumor

Updated Character Select Button

Added Heal tags to Feast and Treat to prevent them from randomly spawning from potions/relics.
